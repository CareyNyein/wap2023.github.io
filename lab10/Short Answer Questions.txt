1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
ANS: 'setTimeout' schedules a callback to run after a specific time, the functions are registered in the
timers phase of the event loop. 'setImmediate' schedules a callback to run at check phase of the event loop after IO events'
callbacks. According to these two statements from the lecture slides, when we want immediate execution with higher priority without any delay, 
'setImmediate' is a userful tool because it is able to work in a specific event-driven context.

2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
ANS: 'process.nextTick' is executed immediately after the current operation completes and before the event loop continues. 
They have the highest priority and are executed before any I/O operations or timers. 
'setImmediate' is executed in the next iteration of the event loop, specifically in the "check" phase and 
scheduled to run after any I/O operations that are ready to be processed but before any timers.

3. Does Node.js has window object?
ANS: No. Window object is only used by browser.
